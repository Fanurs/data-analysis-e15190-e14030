# Neutron wall B analysis

- Position calibration
    - [x] Run by run calibration
    - [ ] Bar-by-bar position resolutions (update to GitHub)
    - [ ] Error propagation (to final spectrum)
- Charged-particle veto
    - [x] Crude filter (any hits on VW imply charged-particles)
    - [ ] Cone projection filter (or estimate how much % could be improved)
        - Multiplicity v.s. centrality
    - [ ] Consistent with WMU
- Pulse shape discrimination
    - [x] Batch by batch
    - [ ] Cause for changes between batches
    - [ ] Error analysis and time-of-flight analysis
    - [ ] Error propagation (to final spectrum)
- Light output calibration (ADC -> MeVee)
    - [x] Cosmic + AmBe five-point calibration
    - [x] Bug fixed: Incorrect dimension of NW bars
    - [ ] Why the 12C(n, d) peak is not as apparent as before?
    - [ ] Bug: Kinematics is not monotonic, i.e. cut at fixed energy, yield does not decrease as theta increases
- Shadow bar analysis
    - [x] Correction curves have been established
    - [x] Error analysis
    - [ ] Error propagation (to final spectrum)
- Geometric efficiency
    - [x] Efficiency curve for any positional cuts (shadow bars, bad bars, etc.)
- Detection efficiency
    - [x] ~~SCINFUL-QMD~~
    - [ ] Park's Geant4 consistent with SCINFUL-PHITS: Done, but compile the presentations into one
    - [x] Bug fixed: Included (n, 3He) and (n, 4He) that were previously excluded
    - [ ] Light responses: Experimental v.s. Geant4
    - [ ] Why the 12C(n, d) peak is not as apparent as before?
- Event counting / normalization
    - [ ] Trigger condition
    - [ ] Random subtraction (due to high beam rate)
        - Take two batches of the same reaction but very different beam rates
- Miscellaneous
    - [ ] Crosstalk effect (%?)
    - [ ] Neutron wall A
