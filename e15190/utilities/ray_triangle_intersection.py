    In this implementation, we have made some light optimization. When looping over the triangles, we use pure Python for-loop. Inside the loop, we use only NumPy functions to manage all the ray_vectors, which are much faster than looping over with pure Python loops. This optimization, of course, works the best when dealing with a large number of ray vectors (> 1,000,000) rather than numerous triangles.

    Parameters:
        ray_origin : numpy.ndarray of shape (3, )
            This implementation assumes all rays have one common origin.
        ray_vectors : numpy.ndarray of shape (n_rays, 3)   
            The ray vectors are only used to tell the directions. No
            normalization is needed.
        triangles : numpy.ndarray of shape (n_triangles, 3, 3)
            An array of 3 x 3 arrays. Each 3 x 3 array consists of three
            vertices that specify the triangle. For example, the y-coordinate of
            the first vertex in the fifth triangle would be
            `triangles[4][0][1]`.
        tol : float, default 1e-8
            Tolerance for checking the determinant in the algorithm. If the
            determinant is smaller than the tolerance, then the ray would be
            assumed parallel to the plane of the triangle, hence no attempt
            would be made to determine the intersection point.
    
    Returns:
        A numpy.ndarray of intersections with shape (n_triangles, n_rays, 3).
