E51,2018-03-31 17:20:00,Kyle made one DAQ cable by pass a module,(1) Some cables were found unplugged and some modules were missing

E43,2018-03-19 17:18:00,Beam is back.,(1) Beam spot may not be stable so operators will monitor it. We will do blank more often to make sure the beam spot is not drifting.

E40,2018-03-13 06:21:00,Issues with NW qdc4,(1) It's not clear what the problem is. We rebooted CAMAC and reloaded CFDs and GDGs. Still no improvement. Kuan called.
E39,2018-03-13 04:45:00,Veto Wall is fixed.,"(2) Almost all ""resistor"" boxes were replaced. Many fast amp channels died so we replaced two modules and used free slots. All the detectors were brought back to life but the gain changed on almost all of them so we had to calibrate them again to roughly 17MeV range."

E19,2018-03-08 23:40:23,Changes to VW,"(1) TDC 127 has a copy at TDC126 for B05 bottom. Before TDC 127 was missing, check the run number. Bar 05 bottom is QDC 08/05 instead of QDC 07/09"
E20,2018-03-08 18:30:00,New beam tune,(1) The beam was hitting FP slits that were very narrow (5mm). We were getting almost 2k triggers with blank!. Tom opened the slits and the problem got fixed. The rate with blank target dropped to about 10/sec.
E15,2018-02-25 23:00:00,End of the first part of the campaign. Gave the key to operator at 11pm.,none
E14,2018-02-25 13:42:00,Adjusted voltage on Detector 21 (B20).,"(1) B21 top HV: (top) changed from 924V to 1024V, (bottom) changed from 952V to 1052V. Somehow, Detector 5 (B04) QDC signal looks good. It's possible one of the cables doesn't have a good contact (OR fast amp connectors)."

E1,2018-02-21 10:10:20,New tune of 40Ca@140 MeV,(1) Tom developed a new tune of Ca40@140MeV/u beam that is very similar to Ca40@56MeV/u. It's supposed to be better.
